## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

## My process

### Built with

- React (used useState and useEffect hooks)
  - First time using styled-components
  - First time using react-loader-spinner
- Made API calls within useEffect hook
- Flexbox for layouts
- JSX for markups in react components
- Desktop-first workflow with media queries for mobile

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at building a React component with hooks and calling an API.

This was also my first time using Styled Components and I really like having the styling in the JS files. I also think the way Styled Components handles themes and global styles is a lot more familiar to what I'm used to working with when building a more standard HTML/CSS page.
